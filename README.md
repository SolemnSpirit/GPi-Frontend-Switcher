# Frontend Switcher
<br />
This Script will allow you to easily switch between the EmulationStation and Pegasus frontends on your RetroFlag Gpi Case.
<br />
<br />
## So what does it do?
<br />
The script will handle:
- The installation of the Pegasus frontend
- The configuration of settings in the autostart.sh and multiswitch.sh files, enabling start on boot and safe shutdown.
- The installation setting and updating of GPiOs. A theme created by SinisterSpatula, designed for the GPi Case screen resolution.
<br />
## Hold your horses, I want to go back !
<br />
Changed your mind and want to go back to EmulationStation ? No problem !
The script is available as an option in the Pegasus menu so it's just as easy to go back as it was to get there.
