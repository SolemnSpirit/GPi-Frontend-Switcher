# Frontend Switcher
  
This Script will allow you to easily switch between the EmulationStation and Pegasus frontends on your RetroFlag Gpi Case.

## So what does it do?  

The script will handle:
- The installation of the Pegasus frontend
- The configuration of settings in the autostart.sh and multiswitch.sh files, enabling start on boot and safe shutdown.
- The installation setting and updating of GPiOs - A theme created by SinisterSpatula, designed for the GPi Case screen resolution.

## Hold your horses, I want to go back !

Changed your mind and want to go back to EmulationStation ? No problem !
The script is available as an option in the Pegasus menu so it's just as easy to go back as it was to get there.
